This is the conclusion project in Advanced Programming in C language in the Academic Collage of Tel Aviv-Yaffa.

The Purpose of the Project is a simple draughts game.
In the Droughts Board there is 8 Rows and 8 Columns.
The place of the checker is defined by two letters, a letter for the row (A to H).
And a letter for the column(1 to 8).

Rules of the game:
In the game there is two players called T and B.
The game operates only on the grey checkers when T is moving from top to bottom.
and B is moving from bottom to the top.

Each player has 12 soldiers at the beginning of the game.
Each Player advances at his own turn.
a soldier can move to one of the two checkers that are next to him on his left, or his right, whereas it's available.
In case the checker is not available and contains an enemy soldier, but the checker afterwards is available,
the player can hop over the enemy soldier and by that taking out that specific enemy soldier out of the game.
That move called a capture.
In case another capture is available after capturing, the player can keep hoping over and in that way keep capturing more enemy soldiers.

The machine is playing against himself.

The game finishes when one of the scenarios happens.
1) One of the Players has no more soldiers.
2) When one of T soldiers reaches line H.
3) When one of B soldiers reaches line A.
